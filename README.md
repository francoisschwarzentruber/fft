# FFT

This tool shows the circuit of the Fast Fourier Transform for an input of 8 complex numbers (i.e. a polynomial of degree 7). The user can modify with the mouse the input, and see in real-time the output of the FFT algorithm.

## Screenshot

As shown in the screenshot, the complex numbers are shown as vectors in the plane (defined by the real and imaginary coordinates).

## Features

- The user can **change the input values** by dragging the vectors (the vectors in the left-most colmun)
- The tool shows all the intermediate values. Each intermediate value is the sum of the displayed vectors. The output of the whole circuit is the right-most column.
- Hovering on intermediate steps shows the **computation of the intermediate values**. The equation is shown in the top-right corner of the screen.
